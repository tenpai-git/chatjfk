In September/October 1963, Lee Harvey Oswald ~
approached the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City in an attempt
. to get a visa allowing him to return to the USSR.
: Kostikov, as a consular officer, handled this visa
: request. We have no information which indicates any
: relationship between these individuals other than for the
purpose of Oswald's making his visa request.
Kostikov returned to Mexico City for a second tour of
duty in July 1968. During this tour he was again assigned
to the consular section and was a second secretary. It
appeared that he was tasked with following the activities
of the Central American communist parties,-dnd left-wing
groups, and he met often with members of* these groups,
reportedly providing them with funds and technical
guidance. In July/August 1969, Kostikov made an unusual
TDY trip to Moscow lasting three weeks. (His family
remained in Mexico.) In July 1970 he made a four-day trip
. to Havana.
Kostikov's tour in Mexico ended unexpectedly in
September 1971. Our information indicated that he was
not due to leave for another three to four months, and at
the time of his departure, there was some speculation that
the suddenness of his departure was due to the fact that = me
he was known to Lyalin. go - Pe ST
