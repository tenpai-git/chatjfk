- 1. INTRODUCTION. In Reference E, JMWAVE forwarded a review
of the nature of its relationship with AMCARBON-2, This review
indicates that the relationship with AMNCARBON-2 evolved from that
action which was taken in September 1962 to insure that a security
breach would not occur as a result of an investigation which was i
being carried out by the Identity 1 relative to the fact that the i
establishment .of the Identity 2 was being. kept from the YOBELT Ht
South Campus as a: result of security restrictions which were in some {
way, related to JMDUSK, While the relationship with AMCARDON-2 :
stemmed from the remedial action which had been taken in a crisis 1
situation, the establishment of a working relationship with. the \
Identity 3 was an objective which JMWAVE had always hoped to obtain. x
As a matter of. fact, in Reference A, the recommendation was made \
that JMVAVE be given. approval to contact the major South Florida — f
\ news media in an attempt to work out a relationship with these new: yi
media which would insure that they did not turn the publicity fet
spotlight on those KUBARK activities in South Florida which might t
_ come to their attention, Thus, when a relationship was established i
with AMCARBON-2, it was carefully cultivated in order that JMVAVE a
might be able to use this contact at the Identity 3 as a means of i
achieving the objective of having a relationship with the Identity 3, E
which would simultaneously insure the security of JMWAVE's operations ie
and give JMWAVE an outlet into the press which could be used for q
_ surfacing certain select -propaganda items. . In the period October to 4
