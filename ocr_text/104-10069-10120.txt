SUBJECT: Cuban Refugee Group
oC ay
1. Enclosed are three names provided by (George Hauer J
of Cleveland, Ohio. These apparently are the leaders of the
Cuban group which you and T have discussed in some detail, .
For the record 7 Hauer [Bt in touch with me because we had :
some rather extensive debriefing sessions in 1959, and .
apparently he prefers to continue that relationship for the . .
Present. Headquarters! records will show, however, that Be :
he was interviewed by Gene Rittenburg in September 196¢. >
2. The Cubans listed on the enclosure are the leaders . i
of a small group which is shuttling back and forth to Cuba - 2 .
for the purpose of establishing reception groups, taking in \ : 1
medical supplies, ammunition and weapons, and to bring out
other Cubans who wish to leave the country. As you know
from our discussions, they are seeking help in the form of
supplies, ete. CHaueifinderstands that no help will be given
without some measure of control by our Agency, and he
agreed to provide the names for Agency consideration. oe
third man on the list is in Cuba at the present time. Bauer}
specifically requested that we treat any on-the-street ° .
investigation with Great care, 5 H
i
3. Please expedite any checking you might do ay give i wet
me your expression of interest as soon as possible. Heuer] of 2 - i
is not an exceptionally patient man, and I certainly expect, i
to receive an inquiry from him in the near future. I believe iy ni
he is genuinely motivated and quite capable » and in his : j
resent position of recruiting executive personnel for : |
fEmst & Ernst he could be quite useful to the Agency. _ 7) ‘
