. 2, We have been in recent contact with Edward Scannell’ Butler, Executive
' Vice President and Staff Director, and have received his assurances of whole- -
hearted cooperation in our agency's mission. (Yesterday we examined all of the
sec files of correspondence between Hr. Butler and personnel of various radio- .
po stations in 16 Latin American countries.| In order to build up a market for
the Truth Tapes program in Latin America, Mr. Butler first obtained from the
appropriate consul in New Orleans a list of the radio stations in operatisn in
his country. He next wrote the administrative personnel of these stations
about the anti-Communist purpose of INCA and offered to supply each station
with Truth Tapes. Those stations requesting them were then provided with a .
series of the tapes. One or two years later, Mr. Sutter sent the participating
aes station a questionnaire designed to elicit information. about audience response
Ben to the Truth Tapes program. Copies of the first questionnaire and of a revised
ree one are attached for your information. Judging by the responses we read, the
INCA correspondence files will provide a limited amount of information; dated
. i904 and 1355, on the identification of radio stations in Latin America which
are broadcasting Truth Tapes, their addresses, the names of key personnel, the
identification of stations not responding to the INCA offer, sizes of audiences,
and their cesponses, da the case gitrusuar, the exchange of correspondence

This example, towever, is an exception, since the files contain virtually no
detailed political information of significance,
