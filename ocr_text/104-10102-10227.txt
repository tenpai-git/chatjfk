MEMORANDUM o\
i SUBJECT: Tadeusz (Tad) Witold SZULC (AMEAPE-i) (201-50539)
| 1. SZULC was born on 25 July 1926 in Warsaw, Poland.
: He arrived in Brazil from Lisbon on 3 August 1940, and came
| to the U.S. in October 1947 under sponsorship of U.S. Ambassador
| _ John C, WILEY, the husband of his mother's sister. He became
| a correspondent for the New York Times (NYT) in 1953, and
oe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1954 by a special
; Congressional bill.
a 2.  SZULC has been under suspicion as a hostile foreign
agent since 1948 when the FBI reported (apparently from a
' \\ British] source) that he was a Communist. He brought himself
: to the attention of CIA in August 1959 in Santiago, Chile by
claiming (falsely) to be "cleared" and requesting contact with
: an Agency representative. This was the first of many such
: incidents in Latin America, and resulted in a warning to all
: Latin American Stations to beware of SZULC and his efforts to
interview Agency personnel. It also resulted in continuing
watch of his movements and activities because they represented
a threat to the cover of Agency personnel. By 1960 his reputa-
tion was so widespread that several different CIA officers
called for an investigation that would clear up "once and for
all" his suspected connections with a hostile intelligence
service. He was in frequent contact with Communist Party
leaders and functionaries throughout Latin America, constantly
sought out and elicited information from U.S. Embassy officers,
