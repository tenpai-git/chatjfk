MEMORANDUM ‘ ,
SUBJECT: Nestor Antonio MORENO Lopez (AMICE-27) (201-312091)
: 1. MORENO was born on 25 August 1921 in Havana, Cuba. ;
His: father was a Cuban Senator (1940-44) and the Cuban Minister
: of Public Works (1944). MORENO became a lawyer and continued
' to live in comfortable circumstances. He became involved in

: ultimately in the 26th of July Movement. After the revolution,
one of his clients was Camilo CIENFUEGOS. In Miami after

Jorge VOLSKY. MORENO's background as a lawyer did not prepare :

April 1961, therefore, he associated with anti-CASTRO exiles, ;
particularly VOLSKY, but did not become actively involved. -
. He was assessed in 1963 as being unfriendly to CIA.
3. About February 1963 MORENO. and Enrique CAYADO Ribera °
‘reportedly collaborated in the formulation of an operational
plan to overthrow the Castro government. They discussed it
with Jorge VOLSKY, who then passed it to Tad SZULC. VOLSKY
and SZULC apparently conspired to have the plan presented to
the "political authorities" (Robert HURWITCH and the KENNEDY
Administration) in Washington in order to by-pass. the dis-
