MEMORANDUM .
SUBJECT: Jose Ricardo RABEL Nunez/(amiz0-3)] (201-249386)
1. Born 7 April 1922 in Havana, Cuba, the son of a
. native-born American citizen, RABEL was brought up in comfor-
table circumstances. He attended high school in Cuba, com-
pleted the last year in New Orleans, Louisiana, and entered
Tulane University in September 1938. He enlisted in the U.S.
Army in December 1940 and eventually saw combat in France,
Bélgium, Germany and Austria. After discharge in December 1945, ;
RABEL returned to Cuba to attend the University of Havana
and this began a life of job changes, moving back and forth
between the U.S. and Cuba, and, in general, rootless living.
2. RABEL's background reads like that of a man with no
; allegiances.or loyalties and no particular goals. Viewed in
retrospect, his career presents a picture of unreliability.
It is probable that RABEL's rootlessness and apparent
: unreliability applied both to his relations with CASTRO and to
those with the Agency. It is quite possible, therefore, that
he not only served the Agency in a superficial way but that
he did the same for CASTRO at various times when it suited his
purposes. Without postulating this sort of dual role (one
which fits very well with his previous life) it is almost :
impossible to explain some of the reasonably good things he .
did for the Agency and the quite certain allegations that
he was a CASTRO agent. This explanation is not fully satis-
factory, but it does explain his career better than the charge
