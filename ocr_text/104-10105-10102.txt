MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
3
FROM 2 Gherwood R. Bosworth > :
ternal Activities Branch
SUBJECT : Manuscript by David Phillips . .
1. Attached herewith is a proposed letter to
Mr. David A. Phillips outlining deletions which the
Agency would like made from his book. The general tone
of the responses from Agency components was that, if
possible, this book should not be published. In the view
of most, it dangerously reveals sources and methods,
internal organization, missions, and functions. It also
provides public confirmation of covert Agency activities
and the disruption andâ€™ reduced morale created by Agee
and others.
. 2. However, on the assumption that publication
could not or would not be blocked, the operating components
catalogued their most serious concerns. The attached
letter to Mr. Phillips includes many of these reservations.
The chapter by chapter review, which appears later in
this memorandum, contains those recommendations for deletion
which, for various explained reasons, should not be forwarded
to Mr. Phillips.
3. Before proceeding with the manuscript review,
we would like to advise that Mr. John Greaney of OGC has
volunteered his services to accompany you or Mr. Stembridge
. when our proposals are placed before Mr. Phillips. Due
to time limitations, he has not had a chance to review
this memorandum or the proposed letter to Mr. Phillips
as of this date.
