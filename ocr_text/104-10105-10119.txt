ATTENTION: Mr. Julian Fox

FROM: Clifton R. Strathern . : .
Chief, Latin America Division

SUBJECT: General Comments on Mr. David Phillips’ Manuscript

REFERENCE: C/LAD Memorandum dated 22 June 1976, Citing Specific
Objections to Mr. David Phillips' Manuscript

1. The general tenor of the manuscript leaves much to be desired

from both an operational and security viewpoint. The author in numer—

ous instances specifically discloses sources, methods, cover arrange~

. ments and liaison relationships. Various LA Division officer who have

ii reviewed portions of the manuscript pertinent to their areas have
commented negatively on the revelations of tradecraft and identifica-
tion of numerous overseas Stations and operations.

2. Other objectionable items in the manuscript concern the con-
firmation of Agee's effectiveness in neutralizing Agency efforts abroad
by publishing lists of CIA personnel in specifig Stations; revelation

2% of(Office of Communications)personnel in @very Embassy abroad3) the
Agency role in countering terrorism, narcétics trafficking and training
Provided other services to counteract these activities; and, the
specific identity of liaison relationships, particularly, (the Israeli 24
service.) .

. 3. The overall concensus of this Division is that publication of
this manuscript in its present form would be detrimental to the Agency
and this Division in particular.
