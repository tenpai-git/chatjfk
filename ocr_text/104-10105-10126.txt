is the undersigned's view, and that of innumerable colleagues,
that Mr. Phillips' book should not be published. In the first

should not put his stamp of authenticity on that sentence.

If publish Mr. Phillips must, and if the Agency cannot legally
stop him, then so be it. Hopefully, while there is still time,
someone will push for appropriate legislation to stop this .
foolishness.

fact hire women and minorities, this section causes

some anguish. At the present time, certainly in the

Near East, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union, the
