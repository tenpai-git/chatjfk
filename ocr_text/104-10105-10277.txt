: SUBJECT: Meeting with E. Howard Hunt Re His Memoirs, "Undercover"

1. On 28 September 1974 Ray Rocca, Deputy Chief/CI Staff,"

and I met in the DCD Washington Field Office with E. Howard Hunt,

ss sat his attorney William A. Snyder, Jr., and Snyder's associate

= Thomas W. Coons. As the meeting began, Hunt asked if it was

SSS being tape-recorded; I assured him that it was not. He said he did
not care; but that, if it were to be recorded, he would like to know.
We then embarked upon the review according to the plan under which
we would demand the deletion of three items as classified and then
proceed to the remaining 29 items, only if Hunt was cooperative on

; the first three. He and his lawyers appeared very cooperative, and

accordingly, the meeting continued to cover all 32 items.
es 2. Changes were agreed to in the items set forth in paragraphs
° 12, 14, and 25 of the CI Staff memorandum of 19 September 1974.
These appear at pages 73, 80-83, and 115 of the galley proof and
concern the fabrication of the Shanghai post for a Mexican operation,
. the entry into the Guatemalan Embassy in Mexico City, and the joint
CIA-Uruguayan telephone monitoring operation. The wording of the
cs agreed changes is as shown on the attached copies of the pertinent
aS pages of the galley proof. Essentially, these changes disguise the
BES identity of the fabricated newspaper and remove a reference to
journalists as agents; delete the word "Guatemalan" to make the
entered embassy non-specific; and delete the reference to listening
posts and telephone monitoring to make that paragraph refer in more
general terms to our ability to cover targets without referring to the
use of electronic surveillance.
