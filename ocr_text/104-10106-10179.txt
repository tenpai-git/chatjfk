MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
FROM: Robert D. Clark
_ Office of General Counsel Loe Ce.
SUBJECT: “|. PDLADLE: ” Outside Lawyer to Draw Up | os a a
re ~ oT os) Deed of Trust : - eo Use T Ride
1. PDLADLE is a high-level defector residing in New York who has
had advanced to him a number of large "loans" over the years, in addition
to his "salary." Some of these monies have gone into the purchase of
some real estate in the State of New York. The Agency now wants a
Deed of Trust executed in favor of one of its nominees on the New York
real property.

c. the case officer for PDLADLE, MONCURE, who is apparently
a practicing N.Y. lawyer who at one time worked for the Agency. .
This idea was suggested by Vasia Gmirkin of CI Staff, the
client component on the Deed of Trust. The idea would be that
since MONCURE already knows that PDLADLE and MONCURE
would be used only on this PDLADLE job, the security and cover
problems normally associated with allowing cleared attorneys :
to become involved in operations would not be as pronounced as
