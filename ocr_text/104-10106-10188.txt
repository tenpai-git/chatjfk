1. Sam Jaffe's relationship with the Agency predates his assignment .

: to Moscow as an ABC correspondent. During the period 1958-60 while in New _
York Jaffe was a confidential informant of the FBI on his Soviet contacts a
in New York. In addition, he had several meetings with the New York office :

: of CIA's Domestic Contact Division. While in Moscow with ABC Jaffe felt he .
was the subject of a recruitment attempt by the KGB in 1962. He recounted
his story to the Regional Security Officer at the American Embassy in Moscow, — -
copies of which went to both CIA and FBI. Jaffe covered the Gary Powers' =:
trial for ABC and flew on the same plane from New York to Moscow with the a

. Barbara Powers' party. Prior to that trip he was briefed by a CIA psychologist
_ on ways to observe Powers's behavior and demeanor. Jaffe was never “ordered" -
to cover the Powers’ trial, but simply acted as an enterprising newspaperman ~ -.
befriending Barbara Powers while her party was enroute and in the Soviet Union. _

the FBI. ‘There is some evidence that Jaffe was given preferential treatment ~
- by the Soviet authorities. Some western pressmen felt that daffe,.as. an as

times, is Jaffe's belief that the CIA passed derogatory information about
him to his employers. Attached is a 24 November 1975 letter from Mr. Colby -
to Jaffe which states categorically that no information in the CIA files had
ever been passed outside of official channels. In addition to this letter ~
