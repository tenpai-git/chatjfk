SUBJECT : Manuel F, ARTIME Buesa
#20 838
1. On 24 June 1963, Mr. Charles Matt, SAS/MOB/PM, extension
6488, was referred to me by the SAS Security Officer, Mr. George
Iadner, and visited me in Room 4 F 21 to request some operational
support beginning 1 July 1963. Mr. Matt advised that two leaders
of the Cuban Exile Group were coming to Washington, D. C., on that
latter date to confer with CIA and other Government officials,
including probably Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General, concern-
ing the "new program” for the exiles.
oh, Mr. Matt explained that a covert site (#302 922) located
at/ 9218 Aldershot Drive, Bethesda] Maryland, had recently been
procured to billet these exiles and to serve as the meeting place
for these sensitive discussions to take place. Mr. Matt said that
SAS is vitally interested in what these two exiles say to each other
when the U. S. Government officials have departed after a day's
discussions. He, therefore, requested that microphones be concealed
in the house to monitor their comments.
3. Mr. Matt said that the two men would arrive on 1 July and
: would be in Washington at the house for about a week or ten days.
____—. The audio coverage was requested for this entire time. Mr. Matt
jorsstog also said that the house would be retained for several more months
yes. 6st and that the two exiles would return to Washington several more
