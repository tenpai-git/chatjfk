: SUBJECT: Agee Effort Against Cuban Operations (at the Mexico City Station }
: 04
: Ecancit shee al
1. Elsie L SCALETTI recalls that Raymond A. FRADYER, Chief of
_- the Cuban Section, tried to get Agee to discuss the development of contacts
with access to the Cuban target in the O:ympics. In these iscussions it may
i well be that Agee was tojd about LIARM-1, (@ member of the’“Mexican rifle team, |
: who was a contact(of the ‘Station jand Me fe trying to get invited to Cuba, 9%
4 (LIARM-1 is no longer a contact {of the StdtionJeven though he is still with {the
rifle team. }]
- 2. SCALETTI recalls the Cuban Section feeling very frustrated that
: Agee could provide no leads or assistance to this section in its effort to target
+: against the Cuban teams. She recalls no memoranda prepared by Agee for the
° Section, no leads given the Section, and he came to discuss the olympics with
C/Cuba not more than half a dozen times. - :

; $. As SCALETTI recalls, it is unlikely that Agee knew any thing about
the operations being run against the Cuban target ghar that which he might have
picked up at Headquarters or known about (fhe Stationloperations in general --

‘ such as audio, surveillance, photo surveillance, etc.
4, SCALETTI had Agee over to her home once for dinner; there were
no other guests. Agee had SCALETTI, her husband, and Laura J. oTsTNe Ob
(on TDY) to his apartment once for dinner. The conversation was alway: pone eepnny
light. The only significant thing about Agee's plans which arose was his
discussion about buying used drycleaning equipment in the United States,
bringing it to Mexico and setting up a drycleaning plant. This was brought
up as something for the future and just t Sais] was toying with.

5. SCALETTI ran into Agee by chance on the side street by the Embassy
one day after the arrival gy aon A. PROBERT. Agee said he understood
PROBERT had arrived fas ‘O0$S) and he wouid like to say hello. FI suggested
. he call PROBERT. I immediately informed PROBERT of my chance encounter
with Agee, and informed PROBERT that Agee had resigned under somewhat
of a cloud and suggested he get briefed himself on Agee's assignment in Mexico.
