22 November 1968
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security .
SUBJECT : Herbert Itkin/Mario Brod et.al.
1. Reference is made to your instructions concerning this
case and my attached memorandum concerning research on whether “7
or not Itkin was ever, in fact, utilized by this Agency prior to his
contacts with Brod.
2, All available sources in the Agency reflect no record of
Itkin or of Philip Harbin, who was allegedly his case officer. Harbin
has been checked both as a true name and as an alias. Although the
name is not registered in the Agency, this of course does not mean
f that some Agency representative did not make this up and use it
: without telling anyone.
3. My visceral reaction is that Itkin is lying about his
contacts with Mr. Dulles and Philip Harbin. However, since there
appears to be a possibility of an extreme "flap" if Itkin gives the same
story to the newspapers that he gave to Mr. Houston, I would recommend
that, with the concurrence of Mr. Helms, Mr. Dulles be interviewed and
asked if he remembers anything about this case.

4, Lalso spoke with Harry Mason, x5231, in Finance who
handles OS budgetary matters and is a personal acquaintance. Without
giving him any names I asked him if it would be possible to track down
the receipt that Itkin claims he gave Harbin for the $5000.00. Harry
says if the case was handled properly and the account is still outstanding .
it will be fairly easy to find the receipt. I have done nothing further on
this, pending your instructions.
