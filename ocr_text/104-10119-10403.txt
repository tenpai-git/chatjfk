1. Referent B forwards an analysis of possible Agency involvement |
. with suspected criminal elements in the Bahamas. Referent A is a commentary |
on this analysis that details CCS relationships with individuals associated |
with a company that is reputed to be an employer of organized crime
figures. No specific fact is presented that would legally raise the suspicion |
of the commission of a violation of law, morality or ethics by the U.S. |
t citizen businessmen now cooperating with this Agency: Major General |
William P. Fisher (USAF-Ret.); Mr. John P. Roulett (USN-Ret.); and 7
~ “MrT Albert Whisnant. :
2. In the sensitivity of this time, it would be imprudent not to
' ~ yecognize that mere proximity to unsavory elements is sufficient for some |
to suggest guilt by association. This Agency recognizing that. unfortunate
fact of life has an obligation to protect the rights of those upon whom we mo
have prevailed to cooperate. The only direct method immediately, apparent ——,
is to sever our relationship with voiced gratitude for past serviéés in the i
national interest. The timing proposed by C/CCS in.referent A appears '
appropriate, . . |
; . ; B
3. It should be noted that General Fisher's son is a[DDO case officer} :
That fact dictates that every effort be made-to contain the Substance of this :
and referent memoranda to the narrowest possible audience to preclude :
unwarranted acrimony and suspicion until proof positive of eviljor criminal __
—_ activity is certain, which event is extremely doubtful. , a :
