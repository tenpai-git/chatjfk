organization will seek to provide the necessary guidance and
information to help legitimate companies from blundering into
mergers, joint ventures or acquisitions with concerns secretly .- .
controlled by the Mafia and other mobsters.'' For the past
several years, Mr. Peloquin, as Vice President of the corpora-
