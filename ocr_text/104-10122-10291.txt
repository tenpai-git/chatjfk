MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security
SUBJECT : TYLER, Lyon L.
1. On 5 January you queried the Undersigned as to his knowledge .
of Mr. Tyler. For your information I have known Mr. Tyler, who is
known as "Slug", for about fifteen years. He is an attorney and a former
FBI agent, and my association with him stems from the Society of
Former Agents of the FBI. Most of the information set forth below
was derived from personal contact with Slug over these years. s
- :
2. Mr. Tyler entered the Bureau in 1939 and remained in the . 1
Bureau until 1948. He served as a Special Agent and worked in Bureau
Headquarters at the time of his departure. Upon resigning from the
Bureau he went to work on Capitol Hill and according to Slug he worked
for Lyndon B. Johnson, then Senator Johnson. AsTI recall, he indicated
that he was in charge of Senator Johnson's files and records. He also
‘ knows a great number of Congressmen and Senators on the Hill and his
present office contains autographed pictures of President Johnson, Vice
President Humphrey and many prominent Senators and Representatives.
3. Some time later Slug left his employment on the Hill and started
into the private practice of law. He at first shared an office with the firm
of Welch, Mott and Morgan. His contact with this firm came about through.
his association with Edward P. Morgan who is also a former Bureau
agent who served during the years 1940-1947. Apparently, Mr. Tyler
felt that he could not work with Morgan and subsequently he started his
own law practice in the Investment Building. The name of the firm is
Tyler and Stetter. This is a loose arrangement since Stetter, also a
former Bureau agent, is mixed up in real estate and investigative activities
as well as law practice. :
