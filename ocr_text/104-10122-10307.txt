coo . .
MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Security 4 May 1967
SUBJECT : MORGAN, Edward P.

1. I first met Ed Morgan in about 1952 or 1953 through our
association with the Society of Former Agents of the FBI. Both Ed
and I served on the Executive Committee of the Washington Chapter
of that Society in 1953-54 and both Ed and I were interested in having
the Ex-Agents National Convention in Washington, D. C. At that time
Jim McInerny was President of the Washington Chapter.

2. I went overseas in 1955 and I have seen Ed possibly four or
five times since my return in 1957. While I have been active in the
Society, Ed Morgan has not been. The last time I saw Morgan was
in January 1967 at an Ex-Agents dinner. All of my association with
Morgan has been through the Ex-Agents, and I have never been in
contact with him socially other than through the Society.

3. The following information is hearsay concerning Ed Morgan.

I have reason to believe that all the information is true, but I do not

know it on a first hand basis. Ed Morgan served in the Bureau from

1940 to 1947. He isatall, personable, nice looking individual and in “
the Bureau he ended up in the Training Division. He used to give .
lectures to the new Agents classes and the National Academy classes, ;
and through his speaking ability he came to the attention of Director,

J. Edgar Hoover. At the end of the war Morgan left the Bureau to

enter private law practice.

4, According to rumor, Morgan entered the field of Federal
Communications practice. His firm became well known in this field
and the firm name is Welch, Mott & Morgan. Rumor is that he obtained
TV franchises for a number of oil men in the Middle West, and took
his pay in oil leases. He made a-great deal of money in a short period
of time and is reportedly worth at least a million dollars.
