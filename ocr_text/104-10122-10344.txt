SUBJECT: MAHEU, Robert A.
1, Robert A. Mabeu, a personne! relations executive and
former F.B.1. Agent, has been utilized by the Office of Security
on many sensitive assignments since the early fifties. He has .
also on several occasions been cleared for use by the DD/P in
various capacities. He does business.as Robert A.. Maheu, Asso-
ciates, and maintains offices in Washington, D.C.; and Los
Angeles, California, where he {s now residing. .
2, It has come to our attention that the Senate Subcommittee
investigating wiretapping activities (Long Committee) has expressed
considerable interest in Maheu, He has never been asked to per-
form any technical surveillance on our behalf. .

interested in Maheu came to our attention through the OGC.
Mr. Lawrence Houston advised that Walter Yeagley, Assistant
Attorney General, Internal Security Division, had casually mentioned
to him that he had been advised by Raymond A. Taggart, an AID

Committee regarding his activities while employed by Maheu (1954-55).
4. The only significant association the Agency had with Maheu
during that period involved the struggle between two Greek industrial
giants, Stavros Niarchus and Aristottle Onassis. Maheu had been
retained as a trouble shooter for Niarchus. Onassis had just con-
cluded a pact with King Saud which would allow him to control approxi- .
mately 90 percent of the oil shipments out of Saudi Arabia. In con-
sumating the deal, he allegedly employed every trick in the book.
His achievement caused much consternation among the British,
German, and American interests. Niarchus also realized as a
result of this the balance of power and influence weighed heavily in
