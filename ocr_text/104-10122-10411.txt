SUBJECT : Manuel L, DE ARMAS Be
SF#591 865 @

1. Reference is made to the attached cable traffic which i
sets forth the "defection" of the Subject to Cuba circa April iss:
1976. In substance, DE ARMAS apparently gave a press conference .
in Havana on 21 April 1976 in which he claimed to be an ex-CIA 7
agent who had been recruited by a fnu BLACKENHOUSE (no Office |
of Security traces) in 1969. DE ARMAS also claimed to have been we
Stationed in New York City in 1971 where he maintained contact 3
with BLACKENHOUSE and Richard TOMLEY (probably identifiable .
with Peter L. B. TONLEY, Washington Area Recruiting Office). 4

allegations concerning purported CIA operations, such as
assassination plots and a plan to rupture relations between 5
Venezuela and Cuba. Details of these allegations are set ee
forth in the attached cable traffic and are not treated in #
instant memorandum. However, interest in DE ARMAS' allegations
concerning alleged CIA operations concerns the identities of :
individuals that he claimed to have been Agency operatives and :
assets; details regarding these individuals are covered in the

activities through his membership in a group called ABDALA. 4

a Special Inquiry by the Office of Security for the purpose of : of
establishing DE ARMAS' identity, which was completed in October Pe
