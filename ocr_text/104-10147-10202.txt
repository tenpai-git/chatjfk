1. (Confidential - MMP) LIAISON Accompanied Scott :
Breckinridge, Special Coordinator for the House Select
Committee on Assassinations, OLC, and Rodger Gabrielson,

OLC, to brief Thomas K. Latimer, Staff Director, House

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, on the state of

play as between the House Select Committee on Assassinations

and the Agency. Mr. Latimer immediately understood that the

crux of the proBlem lay in the House Select Committce on
Assassinations Possible exposure of sensitive information

(Nosenko and/or Mexico operations) in open fora. He said

that he would brief Chairman Edward P. Boland (D., Mass.),

House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and that

the latter might discuss the matter with Chairman Louis

Stokes (D., Ohio), House Select Committee on Assassinations.

He suggested that the best approach would be for the DCI to

raise the issues we were concerned about with Chairman Stokes

and, then, if necessary with the President. The latter in

turn could register his concerns with Speaker of the House Thomas P.
_ O'Neill. Mr. Latimer said that the House Permanent Select Committee
on Intelligence charter precluded the House Permanent Select
Committee on Intelligence from playing a significant role in

ey this matter.

2. (Confidential - DFM) LIAISON Received a call from
Spencer Davis, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff,
who asked for the phone number of former Agency employee
Newton S. Miler, as one of the Committee staff members wanted
to interview him. June, 0/PCS/LOC/DDO, subsequently called
Miler and, in his absence, left a message that he call Davis.

I informed Davis this was how we had handled his request and
he was satisfied.

I also explained to_Davis the A ency's position regarding
retired Agency employee ‘Raymond Close, who was Chief of Station
\Saudi Arabiai and upon retiring took a position as a-consultant
to the Saudi Government). Our position is that as [Close] has
retired, the Agency has’ no control over his activities other
than through his secrecy agreement which he signed and which
remains in effect. Davis also asked me if the same situation
was true for a former Chief of Station in }Amman jand,T said I
would check. a “
