1. SUMMARY, The Reference A. ANSPELL exhibit toured six an
Latin American countries during a five-month period, February-June | ee
- 1964. With the exception of Guayaquil and La Paz -- where excel- rec
lent resultS were achieved -- the tour was only moderately success- eet
ful, and must be classified a failure in Quito, Santiago and
Montevideo. According to AMSPELL, the total number of persons who
viewed the exhibit was 6,720; Another 2,792 persons reportedly
attended conferences at which the AMSPELL team gave talks on the
Reference A. exhibit and the dangers..and.weaknessesS.of-Castro-— ~~
Communism....Publicity was given the exhibit by 34 newspapers (47
: items), 30 radio stations, and six television stations. AMSPELL
estimated the TV audfence at 1,300,000. Sample clippings are
enclesed under separate cover. Reports from WH stations and the 7
WAVE debriefing of the AMSPELL team lead us to conclude that the
tour was. a moderate success that could have been much better if
i if had been better organized and if the AMSPELL team had had more i
experience. (On balance) we believe the tour was well worth the - oe j
: approximately $12,000.00 KUBARK paid out. We do not, however, ae ie
. believe it should be repeated in the foreseeable future in view
of the relative inexperience shown by the AMSPELL team on the
recent tour and the many difficulties encountered in trying to
organize the exhibit in the various cities.
