MEMGRANBUM FOR THE RECORD:
. . SUBJECT: Bebriefing ef Edward G. Tichbern(P) .
1. Edward G.Tichborn(P) arrived in Washington from his. trip to Cuba: during
the night of 31 Jamary 1960/. "e was debraefed at the Fotel Statler from about :
. 1000 to 1530 hours on 1 February. Those present pane, debriefing were Messrs. .
03 Gast Toone) and Charles Penney frem W# Division, Mr@lexander unter) PP/EAD, and :
6 Undersigned, This debriefing was very interesting and resulted inx a good
deal of pertinent information. The three and « half reels of tape derived fren
therefrom are now being transcribed by this office. Some of the more salient
: points are noted below.
: p24 .
: 2. Some of the operations] information and suggestions offered by Tichborn
: are the following:
: . as There appears to be Little chance of a coalition of the opposition mo,
7 groups at this time or in the near future since they are not well organized
: and each group mant would want to be the leader of such an effort. Also,
according to the muabers of the orposition to whom Tichborn talked, it is
. : the general consensus cf opinion that Fidel Castro is in no danger of loosing
his grip or the devotion of his followersx for some time to come. -
b, Fidel Castro seems to becone most xt upset and almost paniced by “4
defections. Possessing a "Messiah-type complex" he cannot bear the thought
. of someone leaving the fold. Rather than to let such defections pass on
‘ unnoticed, he feels compélled to give reasons and wake excuses. This then
0 blows hhe matter up perhaps out of propertion and quickly becomes a matter
of public knowledge. Tichborn feels that the inducement of defections could .
perhaps have more effect on Castro than any other single, rational action we .
might undertake. :
c. There appears to be a relatively long-standing schism between the
brothers Fidel and Raoul Castro. Raoul is the moze cold individual. As en
. example, Fidel once ordered some 400 prisoners to be returned safely to their
hopes, but Racul had a number of them killed. The general feeling in Cuba is
$hat Fidel is not a Commnist, but that Raoul is undcubtedly at least a
fellow-traveller. Developing or exploiting this schism could therefore, be
: operationally advantageous. (The fact that they are brothers would probably
huve little effect on Fidel who Ras already reduced xtaxemk the land holdings
of hia mother end another brother in conformity with the agrerisn refora
program and who jailed his sister, and fired a Minister, over 2 shake-dowm
on an insurance deal.) oO .
. 3. Of special operatioral interest vere several individuals Tichbora .
mentioned who night have some influence on Fidel Castro and hence might be of .
