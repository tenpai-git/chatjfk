MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD .
. SUBJECT; Possible DRE Animus Towards President Kennedy
: 1, This memorandum makes record of a recollection
. which has been brought to mind in recent weeks since my return
. from Yugoslavia in late November 1966. .
. 2. In Spring 1961, upon returning from Berlin I was :
assigned to JMWAVE, One of the cases on which I worked from
then until shortly before my reassignment to Headquarters in -
. late summer 1963 concerned funding of overseas elements of . .
the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) which had its main ~
office in Miami (the case officer for this group during this
period was Mr. Ross CROZIER, since resigned).
, 3. Ibelieve that it is this group, the DRE, which has been
. referred to in investigations into the President's assassination .
: as the Cuban Student Directorate, whose New Orleans represen- :
tative is said to have had contacts with OSWALD,
4. Uhave assumed that, since the time I was transferred
from Miami and scheduled for my next assignment as fon a+
0 Zaereb,] officers better and more recently informed than myself
ave probably éxarnined in detail all aspects of the DRE involve-
ment with OSWALD, in order to rule out any slight possibility
that compromise of the CIA sponsorship of this organization
might in any way enibarrass the Agency. Recent news reports of
investigations centering in New Orleans on the assassination have
once again brought to mind the concern I felt in November 1963,
by which time, however, I was far removed from current knowledge
of the operation,
