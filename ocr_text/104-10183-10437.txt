| 1. I had introduced AMPUNNY-1 and AMWHIP-1 to each other ‘
24 May but the office was crowded, so there was very little :
| Opportunity to discuss operational matters. We met again
i on the above date, after business hours, and ve were able
+ | to meet in private. Although AMWHIP told me that he was
| delighted with AMBUNNY-1 herself, as he said the ‘Cubans
| like that kind of girl -- not too fancy", he thought that
& her background —- particularly her previously working for the
0° (y.S. Ambassador in Polivia.)would make the operation very
risky. He said that if pit were discovered that AMPUNNY.1 was
| @ penctration of the QNSNAFUL19 office (by the Cubars} his
connection with ODYOKE would the e revealed, with the result
i that all bis “connections” with@UNSNAFU-19, and “Habana” would
‘ be lost. ASWHYP-1 opined that he thought it likely that ‘the . :
| Cubans would check ber out in Golivis .
2. AMWHIP suggested the? sibllity of using a cutout
to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the (UNBNAFU-19 installation. He
said he would explain in detail at a later time, what he .
meant, obviously not wanting to reveal any more than necessary
to AMBUNNY-1. .
1
. | 3. Also, AMWHIP.1 stated that he was unable to travel
to Paris before mid-June, as he had soe relatives coming
to visit him from Italy. After checking with DI UBALDO,
I subsequently informed AMWHIP-1 and AMBUNNY-1 that the
; (3-4 (@ario operation was off. Both expressed relief. I told
AMDUNNY={1 that she could most likely still be utilized in
| (2-2 Gavad, and that we would discuss the possibilities ata -
ater date.
