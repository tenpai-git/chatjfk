: - 1, On 20 May I phoned Subject and requested that he travel to
poe Washington to discuss the background of his discussions with
: OU GNSNAFU-19 from which stemmed the suggestion that A-1 supply a
: - French-English-Spanish speaking secretary to(U?19's mission in
Paris, The meeting was quitg,short for as it turned out, the hofece
"discussion between Subject andQ>19 on the topic of secretaries had
taken place in March 1965, agi had been little more than a casual '
sort of thing devoid of any specifics whatever and, in particular,
devoid of any commitment by cither party to proffer or to accept a .
profferred body, Nevertheless, Subject felt quite certain that slots
; would still be open {i(U}19's mission and that a recommendation from
him would suffice to effect favorable action by (U}19.
os
: 2. I sketched AMBUNNY's qualifications stressing the fact that
she had gone to school in the U,S,, had worked here, and had done .
a hitch as a social secretary for the(American Ambassador in La Paz.) 06
Subject drew the obvious conclusions that it might be difficult to
dummy up AMBUNNY's labenslauf adequately to prevent her from
being “discovered" by the Cubans. At any rate, since she was our vs
: only candidate, Subject agreed to meet with her in New York so that
together they could thresh out the pragmatics of the problem. The
meeting was set for 22 May. Al Marin (alias) would participate in this .
meeting. :
