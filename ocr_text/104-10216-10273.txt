| 1. OPERATIONAL ACTIVITY : 7
H A. Preparations were underway in early November to |
dispatch ANTRUNK-13 to Madrid in mid-November to cement i
the recruitment of AKTEUNK-19. These plans fell :
through when the Madrid Station notified Headquarters i
and WAVE thet their workload would not allow sufficient '
case officer time to handle AMTEUNK~-13 in Madrid at this :

! abated somevhat. |
B. The prospects of finalizing the recruitment of : . i
AMTRUKK-19 increased however with the receipt at WAVE }

traces on AMTRUNK~19's friend, IDEN A, were fragmentary,
. Mexico Station stated that IDEN A was well-known to one :
of its PBRUMEN assets who vouched for IDEN A's loyalties. t
q WAVE intends to send an innocuous letter to AMTRUNZ-19 in aa
ANTRUNK-13's handwriting to keep the channel with 4-19 1 i

and has stated in both letters that he has considerable '
information to discuss in detail. It is well realized I.
that this open letter channel is far from ideal but it ‘
is hoped that in early January 1965 ANTRUNK-13 can re- |
