SUBJECT 2 Willies 8. MARTIN
1, On 15 January 1968 this Ageacy receives the :
following toformation from our liaison contact io tho
. Canadian Departneat of State for Extersal Affairs: | .
‘ a. The Canadian Press Correspondent ta Moscov, :
Williag BUCKLEY, approached our Eubasey infornally in the
miodle of Leceaber on behalf of éilliam MARTIN, the
