With respect to the relationship to the CIA of the seven
individuals involved in the Watergate burglary, one of them at the
time of the break-in was -a part-time contract employee (Martinez), . :
one was a former full-time contract employee (Barker), two were
: retired staff employees (Hunt and McCord). The remaining
individuals (Liddy, Sturgis and Gonzalez) were never connected :
with CIA in any capacity. (See attached sheet for details on these :
seven individuals). [Dhese facts have heen set _foxth previously in

a “4 members of the:Annropriations Gommitter are fully aware ofall
ye significant developments in this area]
. Not all contract employees have the same type of contract.
Some are subject to all the controls that are placed on regular staff
employees. Others, however, are employed for a specific purpose,
generally limited in time, for the use of their talents and/or disciplines
in meeting a particular need of the Agency, and these are not all
subject to all the controls which apply to full-time staff employees.
Both Barker and Martinez were in this latter category of contract
employees. The obligations of such contract employees are as stated
in their contracts.
