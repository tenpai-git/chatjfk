MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. William E. Colby
SUBJECT: - Special Activities
1. Following our recent conversation, I have
searched my memory and Mr. McCone's files for examples
of activities which to hostile observers or to someone
without complete knowledge and with a special kind of
: motivation could be interpreted as examples of activities
exceeding CIA's charter.
2. First, as we discussed, on 7 March 1962,
DCI McCone, under pressure from Attorney General Robert
F. Kennedy, agreed to tap the telephones of columnists
Robert S. Allen and Paul Scott in an effort to identify
their sources for classified information which was appear -
ing in their columns. Because the primary source appeared
to be in the Department of Defense, McCone ordered me
personally to brief General Joe Carroll, Director of DIA,
orally, which I did. I understand more complete information
on this operation is available from the Director of Security.
I, personally, managed to avoid gaining any knowledge of
what precise actions were taken, what information was gained,
what was done with it, and when the operation was terminated.
3.. As a result of a developing relationship with
Pirtiippe“de-Vosjeii, the SDECE representative in Washington,
and also as a result of certain information conveyed by
¢ Anatole Golitsen, James Angleton, with the approval of
Dick Helms, agreed to mount a counterespionage operation
against the French Embassy in Washington. This involved
breaking and entering and the removal of documents from
