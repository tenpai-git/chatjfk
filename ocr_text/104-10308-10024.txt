1. Desaription:

A organization formed in New York City on 22 March
1961 under the guidance of the U.S. Government for the purpose
of unifying the various exile groups in the U.S. File smacks
of exile disappointment in U.S. Government's policy which
seemed to abandon plans to liberate Cuba. (See attached.)
Material concerns resignations, coalitions, agreements,

sai in-fighting, political aspirations of the various players,
organizational structure and financing.
2. Findings:

WAVE 6617 (IN 98730) dated 1 April 1963:

Cable from WAVE to Headquarters. Stated that the
exile colony is in an uproar over notices to the Cuban exile
action leaders prohibiting travel outside of Dade County.
Reaction among exiles appears universal over this issue and
was anti-U.S. and anti-Kennedy. Even though notices only sent
to selected leaders, the order was interpreted as applicable
to all exiles and the beginning of co-existence.
