oo,
: 1. AMLILAC/33 obtained the following information from
. IDEN A and IDEN B, former members of the AMWORLD Group. The
date of the information is mid-july 1964.
: a. IDEN A was an instructor in’a commando section
headed by. IDEN C, in a camp located near IDEN D. He was
given the job of instruction in the AR-15 and AR-10 rifles.
Since no manuals were available he had to use the book,
Small Arms of the World. The men in IDEN C's command are
unhappy because they do not trust the planning judgement of
. IDEN C. The second in command, IDEN E, is so hated by the
men that when IDEN C leaves the camp he has to take IDEN E .
, with him.
Eee b. The Intelligence, Chief of AMWORLD is IDEN F. He
-maintains that the prerequisgte for men in the INTEL section
is personal loyalty to AMBIDBY/1. At one time a PBPRIMER,
who works with AMBIDDY/1, prflsented IDEN F with a list of
i— men for duty in the Intel section. IDEN F accepted the
list and the men but after the PBPRIMER left he transferred :
the men to other sections. Recently IDEN F arrested a man
in the Group and charged him as a spy for AMBANG/1. The
man was physically beaten and jailed. Later IDEN F admitted
he made a mistake, released the man, gave him several hundred
| dollars and told him to forget the incident.
