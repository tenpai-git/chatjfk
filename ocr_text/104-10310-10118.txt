MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT: Chief, CI Meeting. with Mr.. Paul. Wallach, Chief
oe Counsel of Senate Select Committee on Intel-
ligence - . .
. This meeting occurred on Wednesday, 29 October 1975
ot as a result of concern on the part of Senate Select
Committee officers that the Agency.was not forthcoming
with file material related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case,
i.e., ‘the assassination of President. Kennedy. The
following points were made by the principals as indicated.
Chief, CI - To open the meeting Mr. Kalaris made it.clear
that the Agency is anxious to demonstrate that we have
nothing to hide and that all pertinent material was made
available to the Warren Commission. He added that the
< procedure for making material available to the Senate
Staff posed certain problems with regard to sources,
. methods and liaison, which were delaying the turnover of
i material. He then presented several examples of the
sanitization process in which cables. taken directly from
.. the 201 file were edited so that all evidence of source,
method and liaison information was removed.
Chief Counsel.- As. an opening reply Mr. Wallach stated
that his position was that he considered that the Senate
Committee should have the same access as the Rockefetler
Commission. He added that in his discussions with several
senators on his committee they had mentioned reports that
a Rockefeller reviewing official by the name of Belin who
had had access to the original file,had appeared on several
talk shows and was going to write a book based on his
review of Agency holdings on the Oswald case.
Chief, CI - Mr. Kalaris then pointed out that there were .
certain particularly sensitive aspects of the material
which could not be released for use outside of the building.
