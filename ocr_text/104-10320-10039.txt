<Dear Cnarlesy-, ; ef
Thank you for your letter of 15 October _
recomuending against the declassification of :
Yarren Coumission docusent Cu-d71. I might
mention trat our inquiry to you in August (1968)
was in anticipation of further pressure for the
release of Warren Coamission papers, a pressure
which hag not materialized. Accordingly, thore is
not, at the pressat tins, any intention to release
Cu-972. .
Should the question be raised at sono future
time, the points made by you in your letter provide H
every renson to keep the document out of the :
public domain. |
With kindeat regards, |
Sincerely, ;
Js Richerd Yelary’ :
