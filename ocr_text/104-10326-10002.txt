LONDON RECEIVED A COPY OF THE INTERVIEW RESULTS IN 1963). THE

WITH BRACKETS. WE CERTAINLY WILL FORWARD TO THE DO REVIEW TEAM
“ANY ADDITIONAL DELETIONS REQUESTED BY STATION AND/OR BSS. ABSENT
THESE FEW PASSAGES ABOUT US/UK INTELLIGENCE, THE DOCUMENT DOES NOT
APPEAR TO AFFECT CURRENT CIA EQUITIES; ON ITS FACE, IT ALSO DOES
NOT APPEAR DAMAGING TO UK INTERESTS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE EXTREMELY
CONCERNED ABOUT THE DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION GIVEN TO US BY
SECRET
