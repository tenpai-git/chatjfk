* 2. THE<JFK ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD (ARRB) IS A
PRESIDENTIALLY-APPOINTED BOARD WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASING
*ALL RECORDS RELATING TO THE<ASSASSINATION>OF<PRESIDENT KENNEDY>
WITH A VERY FEW LIMITED EXCEPTIONS. THE MOST RELEVANT EXCEPTION
FOR THE AGENCY IS WHERE THERE IS "...CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE
THAT THE THREAT TO THE CONDUCT OF US INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES AND
FOREIGN RELATIONS OUTWEIGHS THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND THAT
DISCLOSURE WOULD REVEAL AN INTELLIGENCE METHOD CURRENTLY UTILIZED
AND NOT OFFICIALLY DISCLOSED." -.
3. LAST WEEK, THE DDA AND THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE
FOR ADMINISTRATION WERE CALLED TO TESTIFY ON THE CONTINUED -
WITHHOLDING OF INFORMATION (HAT WOULD OFFICIALLY CONFIRM-THRDCTE
POLLIZES STATE CINCLUDING SPECIFICALLY CONSULAR) COVERS —~THIS=CASE
S MADE DIFFICULT BY THE PACT THAT STATE Cover TS"SO WIDELY
DISCUSSED IN THE PUBLIC MEDIA INCLUDING THE MANY BOOKS AUTHORED BY
FORMER CIA EMPLOYEES; HOWEVER, THE USG HAS NEVER OFFICIALLY
RELEASED THE FACT OF STATE COVER. ALTHOUGH THE ISSUB WAS BRIEFED
IN DEPTH, THE BOARD HAS REQUESTED ADDITIONAL CONCRETE DAMAGE
VIS-A-VIS THE COUNTRIES SPECIFIED IN THE DOCUMENTS AT
ISSUE--MOSCOW, PARIS, MEXICO CITY AND BUENOS AIRES.
4. ACCORDINGLY, WE NEED YOUR SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE
DAMAGE THAT COULD ARISE IF OFFICIAL USG-DOCUMENTS WERE RELEASED
WHECH-CONEERMS-CEATUSE”OF STATE COVER. THAT DAMAGE COULD TRKE~THE
FORM OF HARM OR INTERFERE WITH CURRENT DIPLOMATIC INTERESTS ._ THE
