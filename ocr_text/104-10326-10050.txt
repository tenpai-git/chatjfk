‘ 2. AMBASSADOR MONDALE, THE EMBASSY AND THE STATION STRONGLY i
OPPOSE RELEASE TO THE PUBLIC OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A
CIA STATION IN JAPAN. SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES F
FOR US-JAPAN RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY F
AND ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED. IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING f
EARLIER CONTROVERSIES OVER ALLEGED CIA WIRETAPPING OF THE MAN WHO IS i
TODAY THE PRIME MINISTER AND OVER PAST CIA FUNDING FOR THE LIBERAL |
DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
DISRUPT COOPERATION WITH JAPANESE LIAISON SERVICES ON IMPORTANT f
COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES. BY MAKING THE :
STATION THE OBJECT OF GREATER. PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY, H
IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE OF EXISTING AND NEW SOURCES IN OUR i
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND SECURITY. ;
3. IMPACT ON US-JAPAN RELATIONS: THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT DOES f
NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS INTELLIGENCE, AND AS A COROLLARY, Hl
DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE H
AGENCIES. TOKYO AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT F
INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IS ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE JAPANESE f
POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMISSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW fl
OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHICH WAS THE j
RULING PARTY FROM 1955 TO 1993 AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME - ;
MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION. ANY Fi
OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT CONTRADICTED EARLIER JAPANESE GOVERNMENT f
SECRET
