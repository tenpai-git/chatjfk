INFORMATION AS REQUESTED.. REF IDEN THEN ASKED FOR TIME TO FORMULATE
HIS THOUGHTS AND SUBMIT THEM ON PAPER. ALTHOUGH NOBLEHORSE
EXPLAINED THAT WE WOULD PREFER HE, PASS THE RESPONSE DIRECTLY TO C/O,
HE WAS APPARENTLY SO ANGERED OVER THE CONTENTS OF REF, THAT HE LATER
“RIED TO CONTACT BERT MILLS DIRECTLY AND WITHOUT SUCCESS. ON 15
NOVEMBER, REF IDEN PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE IN WRITING, WHICH
IS BEING POUCHED TO HQS VIA TM 902-825:
NOV 14, 1995 ;
TO BERT MILLS:
. I OBJECT VIOLENTLY TO THE REVELATION OF MY NAME REGARDLESS OF :
THE LAW. HERE ARE SOME REASONS:
1. I EMIGRATED TO AUSTRIA TWICE, FIRST IN 1971 AND AGAIN IN 1983.
BOTH TIMES I HAD TO FILL OUT AND SWEAR TO LENGTHY FORMS ABOUT MY
BACKGROUND. I USED MY RETIRED STATE COVER BOTH TIMES, THEREBY
COMMITTING PERJURY TWICE UNDER AUSTRIAN LAW. MY OLD FRIENDS IN HIGH
PLACES WHO MIGHT HAVE.BEEN ABLE TO PROTECT ME HAVE ALL RETIRED OR,
EVEN MORE, DIED. AUSTRIAN JUSTICE IS NOTORIOUSLY IMMUTABLE. DO YOU
WANT ME TO GO TO JAIL?
