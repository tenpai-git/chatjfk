REGARDING EMBASSY SECURITY, OUR CONCERN IS THAT WITHOUT A 24 HOUR
PRESENCE WE DO NOT HAVE AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT TO SURREPTITIOUS
ENTRY. ELECTRONIC SECURITY DEVICES WILL ONLY TELL US THAT AN
ENTRY HAS BEEN MADE, IT WILL NOT STOP AN ENTRY. SECURITY AT
EMBASSY MINSK WAS RECENTLY “DISCUSSED BY CE OFFICERS WITH THE SSCT, \
WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR CONCEEN TO THE DEPARTMENT. THE FACT, OF \
COURSE, IS THAT STATE DEPARTMENT DOBS NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO 1
HAVE MARINE GUARDS AT ALL LOCK AND LEAVE EMBASSIES AND NWBOLTON \
JABRRECEATES THAT. (FYI: THIG TS A PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE Le
WITH THE AMBASSADOR. WE SEE NO POUL ALIENATING HTM BY PUTTING =
