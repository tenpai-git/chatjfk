REF: (UIRECTON SS20737 OF SS5S593m :
TEXT:
1. ACTION REQUESTED: NONE.
2. AS HOS IS AWARE, STATION CONTINUES TO CONDUCT JOINT
TELTAP OPERATIONS WITH MEXICAN LIAISON AGAINST THE RUSSIAN AND
CUBAN EMBASSIES; HOWEVER, THE TAKE ON THE CUBANS IS VERY
LIMITED. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF INITIATING A
UNILATERAL TELTAP OP AGAINST THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND SEVERAL
RESIDENCES. THUS, ANY OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WHERE TELTAP
TAPES ON OSWALD WERE DERIVED WOULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON
CURRENT LIAISON RELATIONSHIP. THE MEXICAN LIAISON SERVICES AND .
SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO BE SENSITIVE RE THE
NWBOLTON RELATIONSHIP, AND THERE ARE THOSE WITHIN THESE RANKS
WHO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE MEXICANS SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING
MORE THAN A FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NWBOLTON. STATION BELIEVES
THAT ANY EXPOSURE (WHETHER OLD OR NEW) AT THIS STAGE OF THE
LIAISON RELATIONSHIP (A NEW REGIME IS COMING TO POWER) WOULD
FORCE THE MEXICANS TO REASSESS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AS
WELL AS QUESTION OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A DISCREET AND
PROTECTED RELATIONSHIP. (IT WOULD ALSO GIVE OUR DETRACTORS THE
EXCUSE TO FURTHER REDUCE OR COMPLETELY BREAK OFF THE
RELATIONSHIP.) GIVEN THE HIGH INTEREST OF POLICYMAKERS IN
NARCOTRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE IN MEXICO,
THE PRESERVATION OF STATION LIAISON EQUITIES IS PARAMOUNT AT
THIS TIME. STATION ENCOURAGES HQS TO CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER IS
POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE LID ON THE BOX RE PREVIOUS JOINT OPS WITH
THE MEXICANS .
