memorandum FOR: Assassination Records Review
Board
FROM: John F. Pereira :
Chief, Historical Review Group
SUBJECT: Foreign Government Information
(We request that this memorandum be returned to CIA once the
Board has completed its deliberations on the issues discussed
below.)

1. (S) Issue: This memorandum will address CIA's position
on the review and declassification of foreign government

: information that appears in the JFK collection. This issue has
come to CIA's attention because of the recent review by the JFK
Board of “Australian [iaison-documents. The Agency believes it is
important to address this issue at this_time because this is the
first instance that this type of €0. reign_liaisonsdocument has
been reviewed by the Board and it is possible that such
information will appear again in CIA's collection. This memo
will, therefore, focus on the larger issue of a United States
Government (USG) agency's legal obligations in the dissemination -
and declassification of foreign government information {but will,
also addréss the specific issue of, the six “australian documents"
- (documents: 104-10012-10078, 104-10012-10079, 104-10012-10080,
104-49 Q32-10081, 104-10009~10222, 104-10009-10224) .

2. (S) Conclusion: CIA does not object to the release of the
information in these six documents, but is only concerned about
protecting foreign government information. Therefore, the Agency
does not object to the release of the four CIA documents in the
redacted form proposed by the Board. With regards to the
tAUstralian Téttérs) the Agency has no authority to unilaterally
agree to their release in any form. Pursuant to its legal
obligations, CIA ordinarily seeks the consent of the foreign
government prior to declassifying their information. (However 7
