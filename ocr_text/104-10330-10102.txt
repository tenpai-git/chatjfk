the CIA presence Gin Warrenton) CIA's involvement .in various ©
non-governmental organizations, and the details of CIA
- funding of the Cuban Revolutionary Council--are very
welcome. I must, however, urge the Board to reconsider its
decision to release déocuments_in_a_form that would reveal |
ithe Agency’s use of State Department cover.
(C) We stand behind the position that we have
presented in writing and in discussions with the Board on
previous occasions. I would welcome an opportunity to have
a senior CIA representative meet with the Board at your
convenience to explain why the Agency considers this
information so sensitive and to answer any questions you may
have. Meanwhile, I offer the following summary of our
fundamental concerns.
