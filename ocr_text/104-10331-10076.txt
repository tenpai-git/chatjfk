1. Action Requested. That you disapprove the DO recommen-
dation for you to sign the attached letter to the President. The
letter recommends that the President postpone the release by the
JFK Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) of the names of two 7
CIA employees who retired under cover. (C)

2. Background. On 7 June 1995, the ARRB made a formal
determination to release in full to the National Archives 16
CIA documents from Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file. The President
John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992
stipulates that the President has 30 days after written notifica-
tion of such determinations to either request the disclosure or
postponment of disclosure of documents. Appeals procedures also
require that the Agency advise the White House Counsel within
seven days of notification of Board actions, if we wish to
appeal. The Agency was notified on 21 June 1995 (see reference).
oGc will unofficially notify White House Counsel within the
seven-day period of the DO objection to release. (U)

3. This Center has worked closely with the Board and its
staff and has declassified about 220,000 pages of Agency records
that have been sent to the National Archives. A large percentage
contain redactions, however, and it is those excisions that are
now being systematically reviewed by the Board which has full
access to the unredacted records. The Board will meet more or
less monthly and is likely to press for lifting a significant
percentage of CIA's redactions. The pending determination is the
first taken by the Board involving Agency records. (U)
