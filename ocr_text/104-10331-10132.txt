Viod-40337710732) 2025 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
cae . _— : SECRET - Working Paper
8 January 1997
DRAFT
Memo for the Record
Subject: “Compliance” Meeting with ARRB Staff
Date: 7 January 1997
Location: ARRB offices
Attendees: CIA: Barry Harrelson, CSI/HRG
®ileen Wukitch, DO/IMS/JFK team
ARRB: Jeremy Gunn, General Counsel
Other members of ARRB's CIA team
Purpose: To discuss CIA's response to ARRB's
Compliance letter dated 27 November, 1996

1. Gunn stressed that the objective of the ARRB is

to assure the American public that every attempt has been

- made to locate JFK assassination related files/materials and
that no “secret” files remained. He realizes that it is not
possible for the Agency to say with certainty that all
documents had been lecated. In the ARRB's final report, he
wants to be able to say that all reasonable searches were

_ made, and where documents were not found, ARRB staff was

given appropriate access to ensure the validity of the
respond.

2. Gunn divided records into three categories:

a) Sequestered records and Oswald 201 --.not an issue
in terms of identifying records. .

b) Additional information/special requests -- official
and informal. The responses should include tasking and
response memos plus search strategy and files searched if
appropriate. In ‘cases of “no records” additional
documentation may be required. .
[Note: I have already requested the DO, etc., to provide
specifics on search strategy/files searched in future
responses; in most cases there should not be a problem
including this information into responses to ARRB staff.]

-)) Records not previously identified -- in addition to
releasing HSCA records (sequestered/201 file/etc.), the ARRB
seeks to ensure that all relevant files have been searched
and that all assassination records (as defined today) have
been identified. The ARRB staff has identified Agency
components/files that they feel may contain relevant records
and should be (or have been) searched. Gunn said he planned
to send a formal letter listing these offices/files but
wanted to discuss with HRG first.
