Notes from meeting with ARRB staff, 20 March 1998.
re Board Issues (attendees Gunn, Skwirot, Combs)
I. NEW ISSUE: Covert Actions -- Document 178-10002-10415
{Rockfeller Commission document ]

This document went before the Board in November as part
of a group. of documents from the Ford Presidential Library.
It refers to A ency (sgvert financial support in Peruvian,
Greek, Finnish, Italian and Brazili ctions}and support.
to dab i i nd. ly.) The ARRB staff viewed
the highlighted material (all references to covert action)
as not germane to the assassination and had not anticipated
a problem. The Board instead questioned the deletions and
asked for more evidence before agreeing to protect. The
sense of the staff is that the Board is leaning toward
release. The DO team prepared a response for the staff in
February, however, it is not strong enough to take to the
Board.

Given that the next Board meeting is only 3 weeks away,
we discussed a two step process:

1. At the 13 April meeting, have a senior official (Ed?)
appear before the Board to a) underscore the importance of
this issue to Agency and Intelligence Community; b) ask why
these covert actions are important to the JFK assassination?
They obviously have interest to historians but seem beyond
the charter.

[Key points to make: this is not just Agency decision, NSC .
and/or WH will have to be consulted; the protection /
classification has been has up-held by ...... (ISCAP?). If
Ed went down, it would also serve as an opportunity to meet
the other Board members. We could also make available to
ARRB any material previously prepared defending protection
of covert actions if appropriate.]

2. If the Board remains inclined to release, prepare full
evidence package, etc. for May 12. meeting.

According to Gunn, there is no way to avoid sending
this document to the Board. Once the Board has expressed
an interest in an issue, they expect to see it again..
ACTION: We need to advise Gunn next week if we are going
to have someone address the issue at the April meeting. If
not, the document will be scheduled for action at the May
meeting and our “evidence package” should be available for
the ARRB staff no later than the week of May 4.
