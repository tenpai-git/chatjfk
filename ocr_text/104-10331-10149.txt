oo se (AIUO) = 2.*Alias Documentation and Accommodation
Addresses. The security file of former Agency employee,
David Morales (deceased -- true name already released),
within the sequestered collection contains documentation on
five of his alias. We anticipate similar problems as we re-
review other security files within the sequestered
collection. The ARRB staff has proposed a compromise
resolution to this problem as follows:

[my

-- Protect all references to official }documents_
reflecting the alias such as (SSN, Drivers Permit, etc.7/

~- Release itéms designated as pocket litter such as
club cards, etc.;

-- Protect elements of accommodation addresses to avoid
identifying specific locations; and

-- Then make a decision to actually release or protect
the alias itself depending on the timeframe and its
importance to the JFK story.
