1. (AIUO) Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly
meeting, we have summarized below the significant issues which
are under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our
approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step:

e First, with the staff, we argue relevance although the statute and
implementing regulations define ‘‘assassination records’’ very
broadly as including
e (1) any records related to the assassination or Oswald, .

e (2) any records concerning the various conspiracy theories, and

e (3) any records within the scope of previous investigations
including the Church Committee, Pike Committee, Warren
Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations
(sca) ,*

e Second, with the staff, we argue that release would cause current
damage although the exemptions under the JFK statute are much
narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and

e Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more
detailed and formal presentation to the Board.

» (AIUO) It is the materials collected by the HSCA which are the most
numerous and often the most troublesome in terms of sensitive equities. They
are generally referred to as the ‘'sequestered collection. ‘’
