Memorandum For: Fred Wickham, DO Focal Point for JFK .
( Linda Ciprian), OGC Focal Point for JFK
From: Barry Harrelson Ci
JFK Project Officer
Subject: (U) CIA Employees Names in JFK Records

(AIOU) In meetings on March 4, 1997, I raised with
David Marwell: and Jeremy Gunn my concerns with the large
number of employee names scheduled for review in May 1997
and the potential harm to the Agency if most of these names
are released. I. found both receptive to our concerns and
willing to re-open the issue of the release of CIA employees
true names with the Board. Marwell cautioned, however, that
they could not predict the Board's response and that we
should move expeditiously to provide our “evidence” to the
Board.

(Ww If you agree with my assessment of the situation (see
below), I’ recommend we move quickly to engage upper
management and prepare the necessary material. Please
provide your response as soon as possible.

Background

(AIOU) In March 1996, the ARRB agreed to protect the
names of all Agency staff employees that appear in JFK
documents until May 1997. The agreement reflected the
Board's recognition of the need to facilitate the document
review, and that it would take time for the Agency to
collect evidence to defend individual names.

(AIOU) Jeremy Gunn's memo summarizing the Board's
approach to the release of CIA employee names describes a
name-by-name approach and sets categories and specific
requirements for the release or protection of an individual.
Even if the DO is able to complete the research on all .
employees protected to date (590), it is unlikely that it
will be able to develop the type of evidence required by the
Board to protect most individuals. Under a name-by-name
approach, we can expect a majority of the names to be
released.
