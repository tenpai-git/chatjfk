Bill re Stations:
No problem with release of COS, fact we have overseas
locations, CIA representatives in specific countries -- the
problem comes with officially acknowledging the stations
thereby putting the host government and service ina
position of explaining why it is allowing a foreign
espionage unit to operate in the country. This may become a
serious political issue for the government, especially in
countries where the government does not acknowledge its own
service. Also can be perceived as “rubbing their nose in
it” and can effect the trust between the Agency and the host
service (violated agreement of confidentially).
Marwell pointed out that this information was 30 years old
and ask what was the impact of acknowledging a station
presence in 1963 on current operations or relations.
Bill responded “opened up old sores” and cited Rome and the
sensitivity to our involvement in past election. Mentioned
the reaction to the announcement on covert actions by DCI.
Gunn ask if stations = liaison relationship; Bill said the
other service can not say it did not know the CIA was
operation in its own country -- would look incompetent.
Mary ask about changes in government ;,Bill responded that
‘ inte). types tend to stay Qwh or its,revolving door where a = .
goody’ ill be back in power at some point. .
Bill comments on specific stations
It important to the story such as Mexico City and the
surrounding stations which were involved in the cable
exchanges re Oswald, then will release.
“Don't take it away from us for little or no gain to the
story”, I. e. if not critical to the story let us protect.
He indicated he could live with opening the stations for
short windows if important to story, but also said it .
created a problem about protecting other activities in that
window NX
