MEMORANDUM FOR: Fredrick C. Wickham @ 00 .
DO JFK Focal Point —
FROM: J. Barry Harrelson .
CSIHRG
JFK Project Officer .
. SUBJECT: Priority Requests from ARRB Staff
REFERENCE:
REQUESTS:
1. The ARRB Staff is planning to interview Russ Holmes about his JFK Ancillary (working) Files. Dave Marwell has requested that ,
Holmes be given on one day clearance so that he can look to the files. How do you want to handle?
2. Has David Vance Vanek (SSN49238-5577) ever worked for the Agency (D0)? Vanek is an army officer who served in
Thailand and Vietnam; could have been detailed to Agency. He figurés in one of the conspiracy theories that the ARRB staff is currently
taking depositions on. Can D0 check or is this an OP issue -- we have not had a lot of luck with OP. Initially the ARRB staff was going
to make this a formal request, but agreed to hold off for the moment. The theory involves counter-terrorism training and the death of an
‘American with knowledge of JFK assassination. - .
3. Agency Officers in Moscow: The ARRB staff is researching Oswald's contacts in Moscow. The records shows that he came into
contact with other Americans besides Snyder (the Consular Officer). Gunn requested a list of the CIA officers in Moscow a few weeks
. ago. Based on discussions with Ellie, etc., | told him a list did not exist and would be considered very sensitive if we did prepare one. |
ask him to be more specific; if he had names, we would check against Agency records. Since then his staff has located a list of senior
officers in Moscow prepared for the HSCA (Eileen has copy). He has now resurrected his requests. Let discuss the next step.
4. Did Mrs. G. Stanley Brown (Verna Deane Stebbens Brown, born 12 August 1928) work for the Agency; what was her status
when she was in Moscow as Embassy receptionist/secretary? She is the wife of George Stanley Brown, an Agency employee from
1952-1962. According to the ARRB staff, she had contact with Oswald (see item #3).
Twill give you a call on Friday to discuss our responses to the above request...
