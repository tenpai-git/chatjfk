whi yt is Q_ “WILSTED emphasized that the whole tolephone system in Mexico
“yh.° "Qdty-is'undergoing a reformation. The compeny Telefonos de Mexico, S.A.,
| “ek: has: sub-oontracted this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone
oat heystem: to the independent firm, Intel. They are cleaning up unused and
yee , old lines, putting in new and spare lines, redefining exchanges areas,
“laying. underground cables, etc. Eventually we should be better off be~-
ae ‘esuse: there should be more surplus lines. The renovation vork has
Gt ‘hampered much of the LIFZAT work, principally because many of the Lines
‘f° inow ape underground and we camot get access to them before they enter
iar tho -gentral., This is particularly trun with respect to the Czech fm-
ay * Fbassy, to whose telephone lines we cannot obtain access from the vantage
ess ee jPoant wa now occupy.
&  ) Be WILSTRD sedd that we try to keep track of the activities of
“| Intel" but since they seem to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no
ng prior warming of their presence in a certain area.
ee 4. In the recent past, ‘iexico has been using houses for listing
we! posts for security reasons. ‘e have more control over the access of
: phone company inspectors or repairman to houses. [owever, under new
* regulations, all now apartment buildings must have telephone lines in-
a atalled in the building by the phone company during the construction
a phase. This means that the lines and their destination are concealed,
iss WILSTED proposed that this will mean we can ogain use apartments since
a we can siphon off a line destined for use by another tenant in such a
ae way that the phone company cannot trace ite destination without tearing
. ae the building apart and we can then instell a separate line to the bulld-
go ing and hook. up. the subscriber to this line which, if checked, will
oy belong to a. legitimate subscriber.
| ge Se One system which has been used effectively is to take one-half
! ey of two separate pairs which have one faulty line each. These wo half
“en paixsa then form one good pair which we can use.
