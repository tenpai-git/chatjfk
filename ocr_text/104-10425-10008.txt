| MEMORANDUM FOR. G 1C 1
| SUBJECT : Declassification of Warren Commission j
| Documents
:
: 1. In accordance with existing arrangements, we
| have been asked by the National Archives to review four
! Warren Commission documents for possible declassification.
: One of the documents is classified in its entirety,
i whereas only certain segments of the others remain in
i classified status. Copies of the affected materials
: are attached. ™~ ;
| 2. We see no reason to continue the restriction
i on document B. Similarly, document A would normally
i require no further withholding from the public domain,
i but we. checked with Mr. David Murphy, an. Agency official
: under (Department of State cover) and he requested that .
Hl his true affiliation’not be revealed at this time. He 32
‘ is still under cover and uncoordinated revelation of his
true status could become an embarrassment to the (Department) .
: 3. Documents C and D would go beyond what we want :
: to release now about our dealings with defectors and the i
: determination of their legitimacy.
4. A suggested reply to National Archives is
: attached. We recommend your signature.
