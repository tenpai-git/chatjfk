I pointed out that there would be no possibility
i of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining
: that our functions and methods of operation are totally
4 different and would actually be incompatible in some areas. :
‘  -Y noted that our modest request had actually been scaled ~
down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited .
: each office to a single Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.
: . I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which
had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin
: and stated that we would not have made the request if we :
j ' shad not felt it fully justified and responsive to the . .
| : ‘President's instruction. I said that we would, however, -
° earéfully consider each part of the request once more to .
‘ see if there was any way in which the total number of personnel _—
} involved might be reduced. It was agreed that following this
4 review, we would meet again for further discussion during .
: the week of November 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations _
concerning the specific areas follow: .

‘ has been made of our. liaison contacts with the, Brazilian
Police or other agencies, and we feel we should insist on -
reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in
Buenos Aires by one Agent_and one clerk (which we intended

P yPRUN Urnere is an abnormally large percentage of Central
- Intelligence Agency personnel here on both an overt and covert
: basis;Jand the addition of another investigative agency is |
feared by the Ambassador as objectionable to the Malaysian .
. Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.
I State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening
i in Singapore instead of. Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely .:. ..
ps cloge'and is actually a better location from the ‘standpoint — - .
of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal
